Ideas I have for potential PhD theses.

**Self-Organizing Symbolic Systems for Emergent Computation**: Build a mathematical and computational framework for symbolic systems (like CRDTs + Lambda Calculus + Git) that evolve higher-level programs through local interactions.

**Decentralized Inference in Dynamic Networks: Beyond CRDTs**: Formalize and implement new models for consistency, belief revision, and inference over dynamic, failure-prone distributed networks â€” blending CRDTs, epistemic logic, and adaptive synchronization.

**Computational Ontologies for Emergent Meaning in Multi-Agent Systems**: How symbolic meaning and structure can emerge without explicit central control in systems of communicating agents - combining philosophy of language, cognitive science, and multi-agent systems.

**Phase Transitions in Artificial Self-Organizing Systems**: Study criticality, phase transitions, and emergence of computation in designed systems (e.g., gossip meshes, agent-based simulations), connecting real computation with edge-of-chaos dynamics.

**Energy-Based Learning and Embodied Computation Beyond Deep Learning**: New architectures for embodied, predictive AI systems inspired by energy-based models, dynamical systems, and ecological psychology (Gibson, Varela).

**Rust-Based Frameworks for Dynamically Evolving Distributed Systems**: Develop safe, composable primitives for runtime-evolving distributed graphs (services, agents, beliefs), pushing Rust and WebAssembly into adaptive computation territory.

**Modeling the Evolution of Computational Epistemologies**: Formal models for how agents (human, machine, hybrid) build, revise, and transmit systems of knowledge over time - incorporating uncertainty, revision, and metaphor as first-class citizens.

**Emergent Governance in Mesh Networks**: How distributed clusters (human or machine) can create governance structures and trust networks dynamically, without centralized control, and resilient to churn.

**Time as a Computational Primitive in Distributed Systems**: Rethink "time" in distributed computation: drift, divergence, and coherence without a global clock - inspired by relativity, biological systems, and event-driven computation.
